# isce_setup
These guides and scripts only work when you have installed the full ISCE suite (see here http://earthdef.caltech.edu/).

The installation scripts describe how to setup the python environments for ISCE and GIAnT on servers that already have ISCE installed.


## Setup ISCE
Clone the repository into isce_setup.
Start with [install_isce201704_ubuntu1604_for_users.md](install_isce201704_ubuntu1604_for_users.md) and follow instructions

## Setup GIAnT
You will need to setup ISCE first.

Start with [install_giant_ubuntu1604_for_users.md](install_giant_ubuntu1604_for_users.md) and follow instructions
